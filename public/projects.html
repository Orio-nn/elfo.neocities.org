        Prototype 1 is a fun codename for a... frankly, right now terrible game I've been working on. This roadmap/description will be updated periodically but right now I've set up a splash screen, a menu screen, and a level screen. I've been trying to implement Perlin Noise for random world generation, but I have no idea what I'm doing. The game I've been going for is a Terraria clone, but the one thing holding me back is map generation. I saw a a neat video of someone doing the same type project as me and they used 1d Simplex Noise, but I can't quite figure out how to implement it. As I'm probably going to skip world generation as long as humanly possible, I'm about to implement Box2D (frankly I said I'd do it 6 hours ago but the tutorial video is 45 minutes long and it's only part 1 please kill me)
        <br>
        27/11/2021 UPDATE: I've began implementing Box2D, the tutorial really isn't helping at all, really just gives you a bleak explanation on the code you're visually copying and pasting into your project. But hey, it works, right? I've also made the mistake of not adding documentation to my classes, I have terrible memory (I don't remember what I was doing for the entirety of yesterday), so I forgot why I made some functions. So I've been going through each and every class (currently 8 classes I'm adding documentation to.) and adding docs for them. Today is going to be tiring as fuck.
        <br>
        28/11/2021 UPDATE: I've created an itch.io page for the game, and decided on an name for the game. Protone, (pronounced, pro tone) is a Java based sandbox game. Currently there are no builds public as none of the builds have the name Protone in the game (lol.) The page says Saturday, Dec 4 but I'll try to get a version up as early as tonight. If you see any strike elements on this page it's because the information is outdated.
        <br>
        3/12/2021 UPDATE: Yes, the first build of the game will release tomorrow. It probably wont be on schedule though as I have both a band parade and an unrelated competition tommorow. It probably will release either late on Saturday or early on Sunday, and even on Sunday I have alot of thigns to do. The roject probably wont be updated much until the following weekend as this week and most of next week will be the chaotic for me. I will still update the game!!! just not on an orderly schedule
        <br>
        17/1/2022: Protone is not dead. The initial project repository will be offed, but my ideas will be moved to a different engine & programming language. (most likely C# bundled with the Unity Engine) One major reason for this is writing code in a quicker nature. I wanted Protone initially to have its own engine, but that idea has been scrapped due to the little amount of time I had, so I moved to LibGDX... Which was also time consuming and I couldn't get much done in the 5 hours I had to work on it everyday. I got to the point of camera movement and Box2D working but at that point I had already been working on the game for a month. Thanks to January snow, I have alot more free time but this wont last, I'll have more info up probably later today (I'm not a patient person.) The website will also be up for it's fourth revamp, which will probably be up within the next 3 days.
        <br>
        18/1/2022: Late update, around 10:50PM, but Protone work is still being done, however not on the development side. I have been experimenting with music creation and some early demos have been made, although these are likely to drastically change over the course of the next 2 months or so. Music is mainly being created in Musescore and then.. shittly being ported over to BeepBox for their square wave and triangle wave presets. These are shitty methods and I'm making a switch to LMMS because I can't afford FL Studio and pirating is too much work.
